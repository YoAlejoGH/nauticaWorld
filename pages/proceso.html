                <p>Conclusions about Mundo Náutico's Internationalization in Ecuador: <br> <br>

                    🛟 Market and Consumption Opportunities:
                    Ecuador offers an active and growing nautical market due to its extensive coastline and entrenched culture in water activities, providing significant sales opportunities for Mundo Náutico's products. Although Peru also boasts an extensive coast, the political and economic stability in Ecuador might render market penetration more predictable and sustainable. <br> <br>
                    
                    Regulations and Certifications:
                    The unique product certification with the technical standard NTMD-0018-A3 in Colombia facilitates entry into the Ecuadorian market, while regulations in Peru might present additional challenges. <br> <br>
                    
                    🛟 Logistics Comparison:
                    Ecuador's geographic location may provide logistical advantages over Peru, enabling more efficient product distribution and delivery. <br> <br>
                    
                    Mundo Náutico's Adaptation Capacity:
                    Despite political challenges in Ecuador, Mundo Náutico's adaptability to address these issues demonstrates a resilient business strategy. The company has shown a proactive approach in tackling political challenges, suggesting it could successfully manage similar issues in an international context. <br> <br>
                    
                    Strategic Decision for Internationalization:
                    Despite political challenges, Mundo Náutico has strategically decided to internationalize in Ecuador, indicating that perceived benefits and opportunities outweigh potential political complications. Although we acknowledge the potential and opportunities for Mundo Náutico's internationalization in Ecuador, we believe it would be more prudent at this time to strengthen some internal aspects of the company before embarking on international expansion. Focusing on specific areas within the company, such as operations, logistics, and marketing strategies, will allow us to maximize success and sustainability in future internationalization. This strategic focus will ensure that we are fully prepared and positioned to make the most of the opportunities presented.</p>
