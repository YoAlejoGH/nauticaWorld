                        <h1>VIABILITY</h1>
                        <p>Viability of internationalization: In the United States, we observe high consumption of nautical products sold in a wide variety of stores and small chains. Water safety is promoted, and different styles of life jackets are available. In the United States, any vessel of 16 feet or more must carry a life jacket. Additionally, in Brazil, the National Institute of Metrology, Quality, and Technology (INMETRO) regulates product quality. Therefore, we see a great opportunity to enter Brazil because our products meet the specifications.</p>
